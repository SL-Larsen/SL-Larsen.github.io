  abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 into a highly susceptible global population was primarily driven by human mobility-induced introduction events. Especially in the early stages, understanding mobility was vital to mitigating the pandemic prior to widespread vaccine availability. We conducted a systematic review of studies published from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, that used population-level human mobility data to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Of the 5505 papers with abstracts screened, 232 were included in the analysis. These papers focused on a range of specific questions but were dominated by analyses focusing on the USA and China. The majority included mobile phone data, followed by Google Community Mobility Reports, and few included any adjustments to account for potential biases in population sampling processes. There was no clear relationship between methods used to integrate mobility and SARS-CoV-2 data and goals of analysis. When considering papers focused only on the estimation of the effective reproductive number within the US, there was no clear relationship identified between this measure and changes in mobility patterns. Our findings underscore the need for standardized, systematic ways to identify the source of mobility data, select an appropriate approach to using it in analysis, and reporting.}

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been distributed at unprecedented speed. Still, little is known about temporal vaccination trends, their association with socioeconomic inequality, and their consequences for disease control. Using data from 161 countries/territories and 58 states, we examined vaccination rates across high and low socioeconomic status (SES), showing that disparities in coverage exist at national and subnational levels. We also identified two distinct vaccination trends: a rapid initial rollout, quickly reaching a plateau, or sigmoidal and slow to begin. Informed by these patterns, we implemented an SES-stratified mechanistic model, finding profound differences in mortality and incidence across these two vaccination types. Timing of initial rollout affects disease outcomes more substantially than final coverage or degree of SES disparity. Unexpectedly, timing is not associated with wealth inequality or GDP per capita. While socioeconomic disparity should be addressed, accelerating initial rollout for all over focusing on increasing coverage is an accessible intervention that could minimize the burden of disease across socioeconomic groups. Speeding up vaccine rollout for all socioeconomic groups surpasses the impact of eliminating disparity or increasing coverage.}
