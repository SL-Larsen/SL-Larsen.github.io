I am a Ph.D. student in the [Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology](https://peec.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is [Pamela Martinez](https://mcb.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/pamelapm/). I am interested in the relationships between social inequity, marginalization, and disease transmission, with a particular focus on COVID-19 dynamics using nonlinear ODE systems.

Before joining PEEC, I earned a Master of Science in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2022. I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics at the University of Washington, with minors in Norwegian and the Comparative History of Ideas. I also have significant coursework relating to public health.

Outside of academia, my interests include music, swimming, and travel. I speak Norwegian fluently and am always looking for reasons to visit! 

*I strive to follow the [axioms](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf) proposed by Federico Ardila.*

1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
