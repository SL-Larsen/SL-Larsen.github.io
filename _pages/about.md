I am a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, working with [Ayesha Mahmud](https://ayeshamahmud.github.io) in the Department of Demography. Broadly, I use mathematical models to understand infectious disease dynamics. My research is focused on the role of host heterogeneity - including interactions between sociodemographic disparities and exposure history - with a particular emphasis on respiratory diseases. 

I hold a Ph.D. in [Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology](https://sib.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-programs/program-ecology-evolution-conservation-biology-peec) (2025; advised by [Pamela Martinez](https://mcb.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/pamelapm/)) and a Master of Science in Mathematics (2022) both from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Outside of academia, my interests include music, tea, and Norwegian literature. 

*I strive to follow the [axioms](http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/Articles/noticesfinal.pdf) proposed by Federico Ardila.*

1. Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
